**Lab Description:**
To create a responsive and interactive web component. The goal was to explore different CSS frameworks and Reactâ€™s component logic.

This lab also demonstrates the use of **three modern frontend tools**:

1. **Bootstrap**  
2. **Tailwind CSS**  
3. **React.js**

## 1. Bootstrap Demo
- Responsive portfolio layout using Bootstrap 5
- Navigation bar, header, about section, portfolio cards, contact form, and alert
- Clean styling using Bootstrap classes only (no custom CSS)

**Experience:**  
Bootstrap was easy to use for layout and styling as it only required adding a link.


### 2. Tailwind CSS Card
- Responsive card layout using Tailwind CDN
- Includes image, headline, description, and CTA button

**Experience:**  
Tailwind required learning utility class names, but it was flexible.

### 3. React.js Component
- Functional component using `props` and `useState()`
- Button toggles a message on/off when clicked

**Experience:**  
Using CodeSandbox made it easy to experiment. Partly because it had a window that shows the effects of the edits being made while making them.
